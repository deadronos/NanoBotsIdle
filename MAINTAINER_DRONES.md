# Maintainer Drones Implementation

This document describes the implementation of Maintainer drones (Issue #18, Milestone 4.5), the third specialized drone role that provides late-game value through building maintenance mechanics.

## Overview

Maintainer drones are specialized units that prevent and repair building degradation. As buildings operateâ€”especially under high heat or overclock conditionsâ€”they accumulate wear that reduces their efficiency. Maintainers restore buildings to peak performance, becoming increasingly valuable in late-game high-throughput scenarios.

## Game Design

### Role Purpose

Maintainers fill a strategic niche:
- **Early Game**: Optional, as degradation is slow
- **Mid Game (Phase 2)**: Useful for maintaining efficiency of expanded factories
- **Late Game (Phase 3)**: Essential under overclock conditions where degradation accelerates dramatically

### Player Decision Points

Players must decide:
1. When to fabricate first maintainer (opportunity cost vs. haulers/builders)
2. How many maintainers needed for current factory scale
3. Whether to invest in maintainer specialists via meta upgrades

## Architecture

### Component Structure

```
src/ecs/components/
â””â”€â”€ Degradable.ts          - Building wear tracking
```

**Degradable Component:**
```typescript
interface Degradable {
  wear: number;                  // 0.0 (pristine) to 1.0 (maximum wear)
  wearRate: number;              // Wear accumulation per second
  maintenanceTime: number;       // Seconds required for full maintenance
  maxEfficiencyPenalty: number;  // Maximum efficiency loss (e.g., 0.3 = 30%)
}
```

### System Architecture

```

```

### World State Extensions

```typescript
interface World {
  // ... existing components ...
  degradable: Record<EntityId, Degradable>;
  maintenanceRequests: MaintenanceRequest[];
  maintainerTargets: Record<EntityId, EntityId>; // target â†’ maintainer mapping
}

interface MaintenanceRequest {
  targetEntity: EntityId;
  priorityScore: number;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

## Feature Details

### 1. Building Degradation

**Implementation**: `src/ecs/systems/degradationSystem.ts`

Buildings accumulate wear based on:
- Base wear rate (building-type specific)
- Activity (only active producers degrade)
- Heat multiplier: `1.0 + max(0, (heatRatio - 0.8) * 5)`
  - Normal operation (0-80% heat): 1.0x wear
  - Critical heat (>80%): up to 2.0x wear
- Overclock multiplier: 2.0x when overclocked

**Wear Rates by Building:**

| Building   | Wear Rate | Max Penalty | Maintenance Time | Time to Threshold (Normal) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Extractor | 0.0001/s  | 20%         | 5s               | 50 minutes                |
| Assembler | 0.00015/s | 25%         | 6s               | 33 minutes                |
| Fabricator| 0.0002/s  | 30%         | 8s               | 25 minutes                |

Under overclock + high heat (4x multiplier), these times become:
- Extractor: 12.5 minutes
- Assembler: 8.3 minutes
- Fabricator: 6.25 minutes

**Efficiency Impact:**

Efficiency multiplier = `1.0 - (wear * maxEfficiencyPenalty)`

Examples:
- 0% wear â†’ 100% efficiency
- 50% wear (Fabricator) â†’ 85% efficiency
- 100% wear (Fabricator) â†’ 70% efficiency

This penalty is applied in `productionSystem.ts`:
```typescript
effectiveRate = outputRate * rateMult * degradationMult
```

### 2. Maintenance Planning

**Implementation**: `src/ecs/systems/maintenancePlanningSystem.ts`

Creates maintenance requests when buildings need service:

**Request Conditions:**
- Wear > 30% threshold
- Building not already being maintained
- No recent request (30s cooldown)

**Priority Calculation:**
```typescript
basePriority = wear; // 0.3-1.0

// Critical buildings get 2x priority
if (Fabricator || CoreCompiler) {
  priority *= 2.0;
}

// Active buildings get 1.5x priority
if (producer.active) {
  priority *= 1.5;
}
```

**Request Management:**
- Requests sorted by priority (highest first)
- Old requests (>60s) removed automatically
- Prevents duplicate requests for same building

### 3. Maintainer Assignment

**Implementation**: Extended `src/ecs/systems/droneAssignmentSystem.ts`

Assigns idle maintainers to maintenance requests:

**Assignment Logic:**
1. Check for idle maintainer (`role === "maintainer" && state === "idle"`)
2. Select highest-priority maintenance request
3. Verify target not already assigned to another maintainer
4. Transition maintainer to "maintaining" state
5. Register assignment in `maintainerTargets` map
6. Remove request from queue

**Coordination:**
- Only one maintainer per building (prevents duplicate work)
- Cleanup when maintainer goes idle or completes work
- Cleanup happens BEFORE new assignment to prevent immediate reassignment

### 4. Maintenance Work

**Implementation**: Extended `src/ecs/systems/movementSystem.ts`

Maintainers perform work when near target building:

**Work Process:**
1. Maintainer moves to target building (via pathfinding)
2. When within 1.5 tiles, begins maintenance
3. Accumulates work progress over time
4. After `maintenanceTime` seconds, maintenance completes
5. Building wear reduced by 60% (wear *= 0.4)
6. Maintainer returns to idle state

**Progress Tracking:**
- Module-level `maintenanceProgress` map tracks work per drone
- Progress persists across frames until completion
- Cleanup on completion or target invalidation

### 5. UI Integration

**Changes to AIPanel** (`src/ui/panels/AIPanel.tsx`):

1. **Drone Count Display:**
   - ðŸ”µ Haulers: `{count}`
   - ðŸŸ¡ Builders: `{count}`
   - ðŸŸ¢ Maintainers: `{count}` (NEW)

2. **Task Queue Display:**
   - Hauling Tasks: `{count}`
   - Maintenance Tasks: `{count}` (NEW)

**Existing Visual:**
- Maintainer drones already render with green color (#34d399) in FactoryCanvas

## Balance & Gameplay

### Progression Integration

**Bootstrap Phase (0-15min):**
- Degradation negligible (buildings pristine)
- Maintainers optional/unnecessary
- Better to invest in haulers and builders

**Networked Logistics (15-25min):**
- Buildings approaching 30-50% wear
- First maintenance requests appear
- 1-2 maintainers recommended for efficiency

**Overclock Phase (25-45min):**
- Accelerated degradation under heat + overclock
- Buildings reach critical wear in 6-12 minutes
- 2-3 maintainers essential for sustained output

### Meta Progression

Maintainer specialists available via Swarm Cognition tree:
```typescript
startingSpecialists: {
  hauler: number;
  builder: number;
  maintainer: number; // Bonus starting maintainers
}
```

Players who prestige can start runs with maintainer specialists, enabling:
- Faster Phase 3 preparation
- Better efficiency in speedruns
- Reduced micro-management

### Strategic Trade-offs

**Fabricating Maintainers:**
- Cost: Same as other drones (Components)
- Opportunity cost: Could make hauler/builder instead
- Benefit: Preserves 30% efficiency on all buildings

**When Worth It:**
- 5+ buildings with moderate wear
- Running overclock for extended period
- High-value buildings (Fabricator, CoreCompiler)

**When Not Worth It:**
- Early game (slow degradation)
- Small factories (few buildings)
- Short overclock bursts (wear doesn't accumulate)

## Testing Coverage

## Performance Considerations

### Degradation System
- O(n) where n = number of degradable buildings
- Runs every frame but with simple calculations
- Minimal memory overhead (4 numbers per building)

### Maintenance Planning
- O(n) building scan + O(m log m) priority sorting
- n = degradable buildings, m = maintenance requests
- Runs every frame but early-exits for buildings below threshold
- Request cleanup prevents unbounded growth

### Maintainer Assignment
- O(1) lookup in maintainerTargets map
- O(1) request removal (already sorted)
- No pathfinding overhead (handled by pathfindingSystem)

### Maintenance Work
- O(1) progress tracking via map
- Only processes active maintainers
- Cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Scalability:**
- Handles 50+ buildings with negligible impact
- 10+ maintainers operate efficiently
- No pathological cases identified
