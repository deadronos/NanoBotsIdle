## Original Request
Add more variety to production chains with Storage buildings, new resources, advanced recipes, and CoreCompiler building. See Issue #17.

- [ ] Implement CoreCompiler building and balancing
- [ ] Add integration tests for storage and new recipes

## Progress Log


## Acceptance Criteria

- New resources create deeper chains
- CoreCompiler is meaningful endgame target
