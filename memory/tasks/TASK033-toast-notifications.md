 **Updated:** 2025-11-08

## Original Request

Create tests and integration examples for the toast/notification system (`src/ui/ToastProvider.tsx`) and ensure consistent behavior across panels.

## Implementation Plan

1. Add unit tests for toast show/dismiss behavior and lifecycle.  
2. Add a simple integration test showing toasts from multiple panels (e.g. BuildPanel, SaveControls).  
3. Document public API for the toast provider and example usage.  
4. Consider accessibility behavior (announce to screen readers) and document findings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tests for toast lifecycle are added and passing.  
- Integration example exists and is documented.  
- Accessibility considerations noted.
