## Original Request
Extend meta progression for long-term play with deeper upgrade trees. See Issue #19.

Allow upgrade JSONs to define higher tiers and masteries; create a balance plan for shard costs and expected run counts.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Extend upgrade schema
- [ ] Add mastery and synergy upgrade logic
- [ ] Add balancing tests and telemetry hooks

## Progress Log


## Acceptance Criteria
- Meta trees support long-term progression and prevent trivialization of upgrades
