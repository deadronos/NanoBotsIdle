# TASK002 - Drone Hauling System

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-11-01
**Updated:** 2025-11-01

## Original Request
Implement autonomous drone movement for resource hauling between buildings with proper pathfinding and congestion handling.

## Thought Process
Split hauling into assignment, pathfinding, and movement systems. Use A* with congestion cost for route calculation and a task queue for assignment to avoid deadlocks.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Step 1: implement task queue and hauler assignment
- [x] Step 2: implement A* pathfinding and congestion API
- [x] Step 3: integration tests validating hauling scenarios
- [x] Step 4: documentation / memory updates

## Progress Log
- 2025-11-02: Wired task queue, hauler assignment, and movement/pathfinding integration. Added vitest coverage for hauling flow; UI telemetry still pending follow-up UI task.
- 2025-11-02: `npm test -- --run` (pool=threads) passes after installing optional Rollup binary.
- 2025-11-02: Multi-drone congestion scenarios still need dedicated tests; tracked as risk for future iteration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Drones pick up from source and deliver to destination
- Multiple drones don't deadlock
- Visual feedback shows drone cargo state
