# TASK027 - Save/Load migration & schema tests

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-11-01
**Updated:** 2025-11-01

## Original Request
Extend Issue #4 with schema versioning and migration unit tests.

## Thought Process
Implement migration helper registry and write tests that simulate older blobs and assert migration to current schema yields compatible run/meta state.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Step 1: implement migration registry and sample migration functions
- [x] Step 2: write unit tests simulating older versions
- [x] Step 3: integrate with autosave/load flow
- [x] Step 4: documentation / memory updates

## Progress Log
### 2025-11-01
- Added `migrations.ts` with registry, default schema upgrades, and applied them through `persistence.ts` helpers.
- Created vitest coverage for migrating legacy blobs and serializing current saves through the migration pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Migration unit tests pass and autosave can restore older-format saves into current runtime
