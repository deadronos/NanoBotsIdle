# Tasks Index

This index lists task files in `memory/tasks/`. It should be updated whenever task files are created, modified, or have their status changed.

## IN PROGRESS

- None yet

## PENDING

- [TASK021] Statistics & Analytics - store per-run summaries and provide exports (JSON/CSV)

## COMPLETED

- None yet

## ABANDONED

- None yet

Guidelines:

- Entries should be one line each and follow the format: `- [TASK001] Short title - one-line summary`.
- When a task file's status changes (e.g., to `COMPLETED`), move the entry to the appropriate section.
- Keep this file up-to-date to help ensure unique `TASKNNN` numbering.
