# TASK001 - Core Production Chain

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-11-01
**Updated:** 2025-11-01

## Original Request
Complete the basic production chain with extractors → assemblers → fabricators pipeline working correctly.

## Thought Process
Implement production calculations in the ECS production system using existing balance helpers and wire outputs into inventories. Keep tick ordering deterministic so transfers and production are consistent.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Step 1: implement `productionSystem` skeleton and wire to tickWorld
- [x] Step 2: unit tests for `getProducerOutputPerSec()` and production performance
- [x] Step 3: add production system tests for throughput, input gating, and capacity limits
- [x] Step 4: documentation / memory updates

## Progress Log
- 2025-11-02: Added balance helpers, production system logic, and unit tests covering throughput, input gating, and capacity limits. Updated docs.
- 2025-11-02: Attempted `npm test`; blocked by missing Rollup optional dependency in the environment.
- 2025-11-02: Installed optional Rollup binary and set Vitest pool to `threads`; `npm test -- --run` now passes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Buildings produce resources at expected rates
- Heat affects throughput visibly
- Resource flow visible in UI
