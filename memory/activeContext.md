Completing UI migration (hotbar/crosshair, tabs/scroll) and adding a Miniplex ECS PoC for player/time-of-day snapshots.

## Recently added/updated

- `memory/designs/DESIGN002-ui-sim-decoupling.md`: design for UI migration + fixed-step loop.
- `memory/tasks/TASK003-ui-sim-ecs.md`: task tracking for the UI/simulation work.
- `memory/requirements.md`: added EARS requirements for UI migration + fixed-step loop.

## Next steps

- Add Tailwind + shadcn UI primitives and refactor HUD/inventory overlays.
- Implement fixed-step simulation loop with interpolation.
- Add unit tests around fixed-step accumulator logic.
- Add Miniplex ECS PoC and finish hotbar/crosshair UI migration.
- Document the Minecraft-like feature gap list and decide whether to adopt ECS beyond PoC.
