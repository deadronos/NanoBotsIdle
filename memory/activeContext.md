# Active Context

## Current focus

Backfilling project documentation so AI agents and maintainers can quickly understand the architecture, invariants, and workflows.

## Recently added/updated

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: concise, repo-specific Copilot guidance.
- `AGENTS.md`: extended agent guide referencing Copilot instructions and the Memory Bank.
- `/memory/*`: core Memory Bank files for project brief, patterns, and requirements.

## Next steps

- Decide whether to add a test runner (e.g., Vitest) to make the default TDD workflow easy to apply.
- If/when tests exist, document the command(s) and where to place them.
