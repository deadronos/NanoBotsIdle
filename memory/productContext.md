# Product Context

## Why this project exists

Players enjoy designing efficient systems and watching emergent behavior. NanoFactory Evolution aims to combine a lightweight idle game with deeper simulation (drones, logistics, heat) so players can both optimize and experiment.

## Problems it solves

- Provides a deterministic, testable simulation for an idle game.
- Makes complex logistics approachable through visual UI and progressive tooling.
- Offers a progression loop with meaningful resets (compile shards) to keep long-term engagement.

## Target users

- Optimization and automation game players.
- Hobbyist game developers studying ECS patterns and simulation decoupling.

## Success metrics

- Playable early loop (bootstrap) implemented and visually traceable.
- Stable simulation tick loop that can run headless for testing.
- Modular systems enabling new buildings, drones, and behaviors to be added with minimal friction.

## UX goals

- Clear feedback for production flows and bottlenecks.
- Minimal cognitive overhead during early play; deeper systems exposed gradually.
- Accessibility-minded UI (role-based semantics where possible) and responsive layout.
