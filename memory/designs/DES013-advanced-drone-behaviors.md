# DES013 - Advanced Drone Behaviors

**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** GitHub Issue #13

## Motivation / Summary
Implement visible AI improvements from Fork modules across all drone systems to reduce starvation, improve builder coordination, and provide emergent behavior.

## Requirements (EARS-style)
- WHEN predictive hauling is enabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL prefetch critical inputs to reduce request starvation [Acceptance: simulation reduces starvation metric].
- WHEN builder coordination is enabled, THE SYSTEM SHALL avoid duplicate targets and complete blueprints efficiently [Acceptance: integration observation and automated checks].

## High-level design
- Systems impacted: DroneAssignmentSystem, PathfindingSystem, MovementSystem, ProductionSystem (for priority overrides).
- Behavioral knobs: prefetch thresholds, builder radius, congestion avoidance weight.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Predictive hauling reduces starvation in simulated scenarios
- Builders efficiently complete blueprints and avoid duplicate assignments
- Emergency cooling extends survival when used

## Implementation tasks
- [ ] Implement prefetch/low-water-mark hauling
- [ ] Add builder coordination and duplicate-target avoidance
- [ ] Create heat-critical routing override
- [ ] Add tests and visual diagnostics

## Notes / Risks
- Behavioral changes may require tuning to avoid oscillations or thrashing.
