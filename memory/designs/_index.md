# Designs Index

This index lists design files in `memory/designs/`. It should be updated whenever design files are created, modified, or have their status changed.

## ABANDONED

- None yet

Guidelines:

- Entries should be one line each and follow the format: `- [DES001] Short title - one-line summary`.
- When a design file's status changes, move the entry to the appropriate section.
- Keep this file up-to-date to help ensure unique `DESNNN` numbering.
