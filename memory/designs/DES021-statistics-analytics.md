# DES021 - Statistics & Analytics

**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** GitHub Issue #21

## Motivation / Summary
Implement detailed statistics tracking and visualization for optimization gameplay to help players analyze runs and improve.

## Requirements (EARS-style)
- WHEN a run completes, THE SYSTEM SHALL store per-run statistics and expose them in a stats screen with graphs and export options [Acceptance: sample exportable JSON produced].

## High-level design
- Telemetry collection in CompileScoringSystem and other systems; persistent storage of run summaries in meta or local index; simple graph components in UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can review past runs and compare metrics
- Data export to JSON/CSV available

## Implementation tasks
- [ ] Implement per-run summary collection and persistence
- [ ] Implement stats UI with basic graphs
- [ ] Add export functionality (JSON/CSV)

## Notes / Risks
- Avoid collecting personally identifiable information; keep analytics local by default.
