# DES016 - Audio & Feedback

**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** GitHub Issue #16

## Motivation / Summary
Implement sound design to enhance feedback loops and game atmosphere, including warning sounds and prestige cues.

## Requirements (EARS-style)
- WHEN heat passes thresholds, THE SYSTEM SHALL play warning audio cues with configurable volume and muting [Acceptance: manual validation and automated flag checks].

## High-level design
- Audio assets under `assets/audio/`, small audio manager in UI layer with volume controls and per-category toggles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Warning sounds help prevent mistakes
- Prestige moment feels rewarding with audio
- Audio can be muted/adjusted in settings

## Implementation tasks
- [ ] Add audio manager and config UI
- [ ] Hook key events (heat warnings, overclock, prestige) to audio
- [ ] Add volume controls and settings persistence

## Notes / Risks
- Keep audio assets small and optional to avoid bundling large files.
