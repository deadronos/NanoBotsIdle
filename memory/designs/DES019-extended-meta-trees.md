# DES019 - Extended Meta Trees

**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Issue:** GitHub Issue #19

## Motivation / Summary
Extend meta progression with deeper upgrade branches and mastery upgrades for long-term play.

## Requirements (EARS-style)
- WHEN players reach high prestige counts, THE SYSTEM SHALL expose Tier 5+ upgrades and synergy upgrades with appropriate shard costs [Acceptance: data-driven unlocks and tests].

## High-level design
- Upgrade data supports tiers beyond 4, with cost scaling and synergy effects. Add masteries and cross-tree links.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Meta trees support 20+ runs of progression
- High-tier upgrades feel transformative and expensive

## Implementation tasks
- [ ] Extend upgrade JSON schema to support higher tiers
- [ ] Implement cross-tree synergy mechanics
- [ ] Balance high-tier costs and effects

## Notes / Risks
- Balancing endgame meta requires playtesting and telemetry.
