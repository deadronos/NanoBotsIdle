# Progress

## What works

- Repository scaffold and design/task placeholders exist under `memory/`.
- Frontend build config and TypeScript setup present (`vite`, `tsconfig`).

## What's left

- Implement core ECS bootstrap tick (`DES022`) and core production chain (`DES001`).
- Create unit tests for balance logic and save/load migration tests.
- Implement pathfinding MVP and drone hauling systems.

## Known issues / risks

- Large simulations may require UI snapshot throttling to remain responsive.
- Save/load migration paths need test coverage to avoid regressions.

## Next milestones

- MVP simulation: basic production chain + drone hauling (target: small demo run)
- Add unit tests for balance and migration
- Create executive PR with design docs and acceptance criteria
