# Progress

## What works

- Repository scaffold and design/task placeholders exist under `memory/`.
- Frontend build config and TypeScript setup present (`vite`, `tsconfig`).
- Deterministic ECS tick loop with production system and balance helpers covered by unit tests (`npm test -- --run` with threads pool passes after installing optional Rollup binary).
- Drone hauling pipeline (task queue → A* pathfinding → movement) validated by unit/integration tests.

## What's left

- Create unit tests for balance logic and save/load migration tests.
- Expand multi-drone hauling edge cases and UI telemetry for cargo state.

## Known issues / risks

- Large simulations may require UI snapshot throttling to remain responsive.
- Save/load migration paths need test coverage to avoid regressions.
- Multi-drone congestion scenarios need additional test coverage; current suite covers single-drone flow.

## Next milestones

- MVP simulation: basic production chain + drone hauling (target: small demo run)
- Add unit tests for balance and migration
- Create executive PR with design docs and acceptance criteria
