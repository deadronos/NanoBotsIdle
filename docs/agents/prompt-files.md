# Prompt Files (summary)

From `.github/instructions/prompt.instructions.md`:

- Keep prompts short, unambiguous, and structured for translation/localization.
- Link to existing docs rather than duplicating them; document failure modes and required inputs.
- Review prompt files periodically and update included tool lists or model requirements.
- For agent prompts, include clear stop conditions and example outputs for verification.
