# Markdown & Docs (summary)

From `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`:

- Keep sentences short and unambiguous; use blank lines to separate sections.
- Use headings for structure, code blocks for examples, and lists for steps.
- Prefer links to authoritative docs instead of duplicating large sections.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with design or API changes; update READMEs and memory entries when adding features.
